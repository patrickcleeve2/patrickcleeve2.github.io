# Object Tracking

Self driving cars need to understand the world around them, in order to navigate. An important part of this is detecting other objects, such as pedestrians and vehicles, and predicting what they are going to do next. In order to predict what they will do next, we first need to be able to track them over time to understand their movement and behaviour.
